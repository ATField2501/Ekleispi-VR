Baby Yoda Rig
By Corey Drake
v007

This rig is totally free. I don't own the rights, as I just created this as a fan.
A lot of work went into this, so if it helps you out, please send the result
because it really makes my day finding my rigs in use in projects.

Please email corey@steakosaurus.com for any problems with the rig.
